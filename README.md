# Bank of OOP

## Description

This python script allows us to run all the basic functions of an ATM, including account creation, deposits, withdraws, balance checks, and even interest accrual. 

Each bank account include 4 attributes:
* full name 
* account number
* account type
* current balance

At this point the functions are all run through the code in the script, but future iterations could include a terminal interface that accepts user prompts to run commands.
